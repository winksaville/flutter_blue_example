# flutter_blue_example

Ported from [flutter_blue/example](https://github.com/pauldemarco/flutter_blue/tree/master/example) so
that it works outside of the flutter_blue repo.  To do that I edited pubsec.yaml
to change flutter_blue from being in dev_dependencies and local to being a normal depencency
and also added .flutter-plugins-dependencies to .gitignore.

See the first few commits to this repository for details.
